# Coding Conventions

- Use the coding conventions and style defined for the project.
- Always execute `make format` to ensure code is formatted correctly.
- Do not create new markdown files with documentation about implemented features or bug fixes.
- Avoid using comments in the code unless absolutely necessary (e.g., to explain complex logic or to provide context).
- Use descriptive variable and function names to make the code self-documenting.
- Try to avoid using private methods in tests to ensure refactoring does not break tests.
- Use type hints for all function signatures to improve code readability and maintainability.

# Repository operations
